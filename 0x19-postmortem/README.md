Postmortem Report: Web Stack Outage

Date: March 6th, 2023

Summary:

On March 5th, 2023, there was an outage in our web stack that caused the website to become unresponsive for approximately 2 hours. This issue was caused by an error in the server-side code that prevented proper handling of incoming requests. During this time, users were unable to access the website, resulting in a loss of revenue and user trust.

Root Cause:

The root cause of the outage was an unhandled exception in the server-side code. The exception was triggered by a request with malformed data, which the code was not able to handle properly. The exception caused the server to crash, resulting in the website becoming unresponsive.

Timeline:

    At 2:00 pm EST, the first reports of the website being unresponsive were received by the monitoring team.
    At 2:05 pm EST, the monitoring team confirmed the outage and began investigating the issue.
    At 2:20 pm EST, the development team was notified of the outage and began reviewing the logs to identify the root cause of the issue.
    At 2:35 pm EST, the development team identified the unhandled exception in the server-side code as the root cause of the issue.
    At 2:50 pm EST, the development team deployed a patch to the server-side code that resolved the issue and restored website functionality.
    At 4:00 pm EST, the website was fully operational again.

Resolution:

To prevent similar issues from occurring in the future, the development team has implemented the following changes:

    Improved error handling and logging in the server-side code to catch and handle exceptions more effectively.
    Increased monitoring and alerting capabilities to detect and respond to issues more quickly.
    Implemented a code review process to catch potential issues before they are deployed to the production environment.

Lessons Learned:

This outage has highlighted the importance of effective error handling and monitoring in ensuring the reliability of our web stack. Moving forward, we will continue to prioritize these areas and take proactive steps to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future. We apologize for any inconvenience this outage may have caused and thank our users for their patience and understanding during this time.
